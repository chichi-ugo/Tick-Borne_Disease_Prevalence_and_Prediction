## Analysis on Tick Born diseases in dogs

### Overview of Project:
<<<<<<< HEAD
--- This will be a comparison of the number of dogs that are inprocessed and outprocessed to animal shelters in Austin, Texas against the number of Tick born illneses as reported by the CDC. From the analysis the goal is to predict the correlation, if any, and to predict the presence of such diseases in other states.

### Description of Technologies and Communication protocols:
--- The communication protocols selected are Slack and Zoom meetings. A Kanban board is being used to track issues as we progress to stay on task.

--- For technologies it was decided to use 'PostrgresSQL' for our database and we will connect the database to 'Google Colab' to run a predicted model to determine the outcome of our comparisons.
