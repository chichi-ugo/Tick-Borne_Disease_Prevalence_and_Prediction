## Analysis on tick born deseases in dogs

### Overview of Project:
--- This will be a comparison of number of dogs that our inprocessed and outprocessed in animal shelters in Austin Texas against the number of Tick Born illneses as reported by the CDC. From the analysis the goal is to see the correlation if any and be able to predict the likelihood of such diseases in other states.

### Description of technologies and communication protocols:
--- The communication protocols selected are Slack and Zoom meetings. Also a Kanban board is being used to track issues as we progress to stay on task. 

--- For technologies it was decided to use PostrgresSQL for our database and we will connect the database to Google Colab to run a predicted model to determine the outcome of our comparisons.
