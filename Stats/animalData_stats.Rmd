# Conducting Statistical Analysis on the Tick-Borne Illness Dataset
In an effort to garner more information from our data, we run a logistic regression test to see how much influence the individual symptoms have on the test result.

## Loading in the data
The data set was exported from our PostgreSQL database as a csv onto our local drive before being loaded.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

animalData <- read.csv(file = "ml_clean_animalData.csv")
head(animalData)
colnames(animalData)
```

Below, we perform a cursory check to make sure the data columns have been loaded correctly and to see what the data types are to make changes before the analysis.

```{r}
str(animalData)
```

Looking at the data, we can see that many of the columns need to be encoded as factors instead of integers. To make this change, we execute the code below:

```{r}

```
