# Conducting Statistical Analysis on the Tick-Borne Illness Dataset
In an effort to garner more information from our data, we run a logistic regression test to see how much influence the individual symptoms have on the test result.

 
 
## Loading in the data
The data set was exported from our PostgreSQL database as a csv onto our local drive before being loaded.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

animalData <- read.csv(file = "ml_clean_animalData.csv")
head(animalData)
colnames(animalData)
```

Below, we perform a cursory check to make sure the data columns have been loaded correctly and to see what the data types are to make changes before the analysis.

 
 
```{r}
str(animalData)
```

Looking at the data, we can see that many of the columns need to be encoded as factors instead of integers. To make this change, we execute the code below:

 
 
```{r}
animalData <- subset(animalData, select = -c(index))
animalData$mm <- as.factor(animalData$mm)
animalData$crt <- as.factor(animalData$crt)
animalData$mentation <- as.factor(animalData$mentation)
animalData$vomiting <- as.factor(animalData$vomiting)
animalData$diarrhea <- as.factor(animalData$diarrhea)
animalData$inappetence <- as.factor(animalData$inappetence)
animalData$lethargic <- as.factor(animalData$lethargic)
animalData$muscle_pain <- as.factor(animalData$muscle_pain)
animalData$joint_swelling <- as.factor(animalData$joint_swelling)
animalData$skin_condition <- as.factor(animalData$skin_condition)
animalData$lameness <- as.factor(animalData$lameness)
animalData$reported_weight_loss <- as.factor(animalData$reported_weight_loss)
animalData$is_4dx_tested <- as.factor(animalData$is_4dx_tested)

```
```{r}
str(animalData)
```

 

Just briefly - for understanding - this is what the factor levels now mean:

- mm [1:'Light Pink', 2:'Pale', 3:'Pink']
- crt [1:'1-2 sec', 2:'<1 sec', 3:'>2 sec', 4:'UTO']
- mentation [1:'Anxious/Agitated', 2:'BAR', 3:'Dull/Depressed', 4:'Obtunded', 5:'QAR']
- vomiting [1:'Chronic', 2:'Mild', 3:'Moderate', 4:'None']
- diarrhea [1:'Chronic', 2:'Mild', 3:'Moderate', 4:'None']
- inappatence [1:'Mild', 2:'Moderate', 3:'None', 4:'Severe']
- lethargic [1:'Mild', 2:'Moderate', 3:'None']
- muscle pain [1:'Mild', 2:'Moderate', 3:'None']
- lameness [1:'None', 2:'Present']
- reported weight loss [1:'None', 2:'Present']
- joint swelling [1:'Mild', 2:'Moderate', 3:'None']
- skin condition [1:'Bruising, 2:'Irritation', 3:'Normal', 4:'Petechia', 5:'Petechiae']

 
 
Now that the data types are adjusted, we can proceed with the analysis.


```{r}
logistic <- glm(is_4dx_tested ~ ., data=animalData, family="binomial")

summary(logistic)
```

In running the general logistic model, we see that none of the variables have produced a p-value below the significance level. In fact, for all of the variables, the p-value is equal or very close to 1. The program also warns that some of the data is too good of a predictor for our target. This could be the major influence that skewed our results.

Let's look at how the model does when we compare it to a single variable:

```{r}
logistic2 <- glm(is_4dx_tested ~ vomiting, data=animalData, family="binomial")

summary(logistic2)
```

Here we see that the the variable 'vomiting' may be influential in predicting our target, where factors 2, 3, and 4 gives a p-value less than 0.05.

This indicates that were we to test each individual variable, we'd gain more insight from the data. However, due to time constraints, we are unable to do this in this analysis.


### Plotting the results
For practice, we will also display the results of the logistic regression graphically.

```{r}
predicted.data <- data.frame(
  probability.of.testResult=logistic$fitted.values,
  testResult=animalData$is_4dx_tested)

predicted.data <- predicted.data[
  order(predicted.data$probability.of.testResult,
        decreasing=FALSE),]
predicted.data$rank <- 1:nrow(predicted.data)

ggplot(data=predicted.data, aes(x=rank, y=probability.of.testResult)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=testResult), alpha=1, shape=4, stroke=2) +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Test Result Predictions")

ggsave("Test_result_prediction.png")
```

This graph further indicates that the data was too good of a predictor of the outcomes - typically we would see the signature S-shaped curve of logistic regressions like in the example phote shown below.

## Conclusion

In summary, this R analysis proved insightful. However, more work needs to be done to see if any useful results can be garnered.
